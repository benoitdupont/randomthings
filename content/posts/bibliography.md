_Work in progress, alpha version 0.1_

_I'm trying here to list the books that I read, and try to provide a few words of feedback,
and maybe recommendations if the book is really worth it (according to me ;-) )._ 

_This is not a way to show that I read many books, but a a way to organize the books that I'm going to read by 
cartography the domains of the books I read, and discover what I can read next_
